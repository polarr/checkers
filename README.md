## How to Play

Generate a code to create a new game or enter a code to join an existing game created by another player. Once you are in the game, just select one of your pieces and where you want it to move when it is your turn. Remember, if one of your pieces has the ability to jump an opponent's piece, you must. The goal is to win the game by making moves that remove all your opponent's pieces before your timer runs out. If your timer runs out your opponent will win.
